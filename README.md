## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

### Dataset
One of the datasets we will use is the Johns Hopkins CSSE's COVID-19 dataset which can be found <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">here</a>.
The dataset contains daily data of the new COVID-19 cases by region, starting from 22/01/2020 to the actual date. The data that can be found contains the number of news cases, recoveries and deaths per day.

Another dataset we chose to use is the NY Times dataset about the number of daily cases and deaths per county and state in the United States. The dataset can be found <a href="https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/">here</a>.

We will also use the french governments COVID-19 dataset which can be found <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnees-des-urgences-hospitalieres-et-de-sos-medecins-relatives-a-lepidemie-de-covid-19/">here</a>. This dataset has more detailed information about the disease. The data is daily and regional infromation about new cases. There are also information about the gender and age of patients as well as different treatment information.

The first two datasets do not require and preprocessing or data-cleaning since they are quite simple, the french governments' dataset contains some, but a daily erratum report is published on their website.

### Problematic
Our project aims to bring more information and visualization about the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Since most countries have taken strict regulation measures these past few weeks, we hope to observe the impact of those measure on the recovery of the countries and make some comparisons. 

We will first compare the different countries in the world, and then focus on the regions of France and the USA to see how a state-based country copes compared to a more centralized one.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Simulations have been done on the effectiveness of different covid-19 policies : https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/isee/covid-19-simulator/index.html#page1

We will focus on a smaller case comparing the evolution of covid-19 in different regions of countries.
