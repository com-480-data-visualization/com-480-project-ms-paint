## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

### Dataset
Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.

Hint: some good pointers for finding quality publicly available datasets (Google dataset search, Kaggle, OpenSwissData, SNAP and FiveThirtyEight)

### Problematic
Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.

What am I trying to show with my visualization?
Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.
Exploratory Data Analysis

### Pre-processing of the data set you chose:

Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

The evolution of number of hospitalisations and deaths has already been plotted for France :https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/a62032a5-550a-4a97-bfdc-8ac909f9814b/page/ArPKB and regions https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2020/04/01/coronavirus-visualisez-le-nombre-de-personnes-hospitalisees-departement-par-departement_6035199_4355770.html . Simulations have been done on the effectiveness of different covid-19 policies : https://exchange.iseesystems.com/public/isee/covid-19-simulator/index.html#page1

We will focus on a smaller case comparing the evolution of covid-19 in different regions of countries.
